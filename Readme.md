# Model Automation

This library  will help in automating the process of model making (Regresion / Classification).
It will help in
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Removing Multicolinierity
3. **Selecting Features** ‚ù§
4. Selecting best Model { Regress - (LR ,..,Random Forest) , Classi - (LogR ,..,Svm..) }
